**kiruk** is a creative studio out of Bangalore, India. It is also a movement — **kirukism** — and an open-source operating system. The studio is lab-led: ISM experiments and in-house digital products are the front door; client work follows the reputation, not the other way around. The OS is the spine that lets one founder sustain studio, lab, and product line at once.

This monorepo holds everything: ideology, brand, design tokens, capability specs, websites, client universes, ISM experiments, in-house products, scripts, content, and the automation surface that ties it together. Every artifact begins on paper. Every promise lives in a spec. Every change tells you *why*.

It is **open for learning and scrutiny**. Process, sketches, dead ends, and wins stay visible. Revenue and client internals stay private. The boundary is enumerated, not improvised — see [`build-in-public`](./openspec/specs/build-in-public/spec.md).

## The five things kiruk does

1. **Run the ISM Lab** — self-initiated micro-worlds; the discovery engine.
2. **Ship in-house digital products** — tools, micro-apps, browser extensions, AI-augmented SaaS, web toys.
3. **Worldbuild with founders** — client universes that pass the non-negotiables.
4. **Build brand systems and experimental web** — eye-first, Awwwards-grade.
5. **Design creative OS** — package what we learn so other weird studios can fork it.

## Non-negotiables

- No trend-chasing. No boring work. No shallow branding.
- Every visual passes the **eye-motif test** or justifies absence in spec.
- No design token without a matching spec requirement.
- **No work without a scribble.** Pen-and-paper before code — see [`pen-and-paper`](./openspec/specs/pen-and-paper/spec.md).
- No revenue figures in public artifacts. Story drops only.
- Lab-led, not services-led — when prioritising, lab + product work comes first.

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm install              # install workspaces
pnpm tokens:build         # generate packages/design-system/build/
pnpm spec:validate        # gate all openspec specs (strict)
pnpm doctor               # full repo health check
```

Then read [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md) for the full path through the OS.

## Spec-first flow

```
idea → ideas/inbox.md
     → /kiruk-capture            (logs decisions to ideas/log.ndjson with scribble ref)
     → promote-idea.mjs          (graduates to openspec/changes/<slug>/ — requires scribble)
     → openspec validate         (gate)
     → apply (deltas merged into openspec/specs/<cap>/spec.md)
     → /kiruk-artifact           (generates template output)
     → openspec/archive/<slug>/  (history)
     → CHANGELOG.md              (why it mattered)
```

## Slash commands
